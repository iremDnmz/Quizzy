# Quizzy

  This is a quiz application written with Java language in eclipse. When you run the program there are two options you can choose. Admin and candidate. 
  
  If you choose to be an admin you have to enter a solid adminID and password to continue (adminID: 1, password: 1). After that, you can read the candidate info from the file. With these pieces of information, you can search, add, remove, and update candidates with specific buttons. Also, you can display information about candidates. If you change any information, it is possible to save these changes to the file with the "write to file" button. You can also clear the display screen.
  
  If you choose to be a candidate you should enter your userID and password. They can be whatever you want. After that, you can select a category. Categories are like this: Hard (History), Medium (Sports), and Easy (Animals). After selecting your category, you should choose your question set. After you answer the questions, you should click the submit button to see your score (Max score 50).
  
  AdminLog.txt file shows previous actions of admin. CandidateLog.txt shows what is pressed by candidates with date and time.
